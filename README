The bezier curve code mostly comes from http://themaninblue.com, I don't know the license, so if problems talk to me.


Dependencies:

    Python
        -scikits.Audiolab
        -numpy
        -phpserialize

    PHP
        -Imagick

    other
        -ffmpeg
        -ffmpeg2theora (maybe use something else?)

THINGS TO DO:
    -seriously optimize
        -instead of doing all the slices at once, do ~1k or so write out file, then next ~1k, etc, then concat files together, add audio and transcode to ogv
    -used named pipes maybe
